# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I found one simple error, having `head()` unneccessarily which was cutting my results into just 5.
Unfortunately, this revealed that my previous bug has not been fixed as I had thought.
I wanted to start work on the test object and run my first backtest, but it looks like I am stuck until I figure out this really strange bug.

**Thoughts**   
This bug is super frustrating and I can't find anything about it online. I also can't reproduce it on a jupyter notebook. Maybe I should make sure the environments are the same.
It's frustrating that we know there are not any duplicate indicies, which would be the usual reason for a `IndexValueError`.

**Link(s) to work**
N/A so far.
