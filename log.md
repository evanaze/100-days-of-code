# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I found one simple error, having `head()` unneccessarily which was cutting my results into just 5.
Unfortunately, this revealed that my previous bug has not been fixed as I had thought.
I wanted to start work on the test object and run my first backtest, but it looks like I am stuck until I figure out this really strange bug.

**Thoughts**   
This bug is super frustrating and I can't find anything about it online. I also can't reproduce it on a jupyter notebook. Maybe I should make sure the environments are the same.
It's frustrating that we know there are not any duplicate indicies, which would be the usual reason for a `IndexValueError`.

**Link(s) to work**
N/A so far.

### Day 2: Tuesday, January 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Slammed my head against the wall for a bit about the bug. That's it.

**Thoughts**   
I am glad I put in the work today, even though nothing came of it.

**Link(s) to work**
N/A so far.

### Day 3: Wednesday, January 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the damn bug. Also, wrote the script for a test, so now we can start doing back tests of real life strategies **!**.

**Thoughts**   
It feels good to be a gangster. Can't wait for that sweet, sweet easy dough to be coming in.

**Link(s) to work**
N/A so far.

### Day 4: Thursday, January 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Separated the `Preprocessor` object into two files. I am hoping this makes it easier for me to create pairs data for backtesting, but I have not wrapped my mind around that yet.
Also, Amberdata announced that they added new exchanges to their API, so I can put off moving to cryptochassis for a while longer.
I also investigated why I could not access my EC2 instance. Remains to be seen why that is the case.

**Thoughts**   
I don't think I made much of any real progress by moving my code around like that. I wish I knew if there were actual guidelines about how best to do this.

**Link(s) to work**
N/A so far.

### Day 5: Friday, January 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created raw pairs trades data. Also started my first Twitch stream.

**Thoughts**   
I will probably want to do dynamic bars next, because I am not sure how to group the pairs data into bars.

**Link(s) to work**
N/A so far.
